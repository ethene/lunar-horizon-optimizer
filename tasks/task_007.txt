# Task ID: 7
# Title: Integrate MVP Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Connect the Mission Configuration, Trajectory Generation, Global Optimization, Economic Analysis, and Visualization modules into a functional MVP.
# Details:
1. Define standardized data exchange formats between modules
2. Implement workflow manager to coordinate module interactions
3. Create end-to-end pipeline from configuration to visualization
4. Develop error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Add logging throughout the system for debugging
6. Implement caching for expensive computations
7. Create simple CLI interface for running the integrated system
8. Document the integrated workflow and module interactions

# Test Strategy:
End-to-end integration tests with sample mission configurations. Verify data flows correctly between modules. Test error handling by introducing failures at different stages.
