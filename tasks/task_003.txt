# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Trajectory Generation Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the module using PyKEP to calculate basic orbital mechanics and generate initial LEO-Moon trajectories.
# Details:
1. Use PyKEP for orbital calculations (already installed)
2. Create trajectory data model with orbital elements and maneuvers
3. Develop functions to generate initial trajectories from Earth LEO to lunar orbit
4. Implement n-body dynamics simulation for trajectory propagation
5. Add trajectory validation to ensure physical feasibility
6. Create utility functions for Δv calculations and time-of-flight estimation
7. Implement trajectory serialization/deserialization to standard format

# Test Strategy:
Compare generated trajectories against known reference trajectories. Verify conservation of energy and angular momentum in propagation. Test edge cases like minimum Δv and minimum time-of-flight trajectories.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement PyKEP Integration and Trajectory Data Model [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up PyKEP integration for orbital calculations and create the core data structures for representing trajectories between Earth and Moon.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Use the pre-installed PyKEP library (refer to documentation as needed)
2. Create a trajectory data class that includes orbital elements (semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, etc.)
3. Implement methods to represent orbital maneuvers (impulse burns, their magnitude, direction, and timing)
4. Create utility functions for basic orbital calculations (orbital period, velocity at points in orbit)
5. Implement coordinate transformations between reference frames
6. Add validation methods to ensure trajectory data is physically valid
7. Write unit tests for the data model and basic calculations

Testing approach:
- Test orbital element calculations against known reference values
- Verify coordinate transformations with test cases
- Ensure data validation correctly identifies invalid parameters

## 2. Develop Earth-Moon Trajectory Generation Functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create functions that generate initial trajectories from Earth LEO to lunar orbit using PyKEP's solvers.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement functions to set up Earth and Moon as celestial bodies with correct parameters
2. Create methods to define initial LEO parameters and target lunar orbit specifications
3. Develop trajectory design functions using PyKEP's Lambert problem solvers
4. Implement patched conics approximation for initial trajectory design
5. Add functions to calculate optimal departure and arrival times
6. Create methods to compute Δv requirements for trajectory execution
7. Implement time-of-flight estimation algorithms
8. Add helper functions to visualize generated trajectories

Testing approach:
- Compare generated trajectories against known mission profiles
- Verify Δv calculations match expected values for standard transfer orbits
- Test boundary conditions (different orbital altitudes, inclinations)

## 3. Implement N-body Dynamics and Trajectory I/O [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Develop n-body propagation for trajectory refinement and implement serialization/deserialization functionality.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement numerical integrators for n-body dynamics (e.g., Runge-Kutta methods)
2. Create functions to propagate trajectories considering Earth, Moon, and Sun gravity
3. Develop methods to refine initial trajectories using the n-body model
4. Implement trajectory validation against physical constraints
5. Create functions to serialize trajectories to standard formats (JSON, CSV)
6. Implement deserialization from these formats back to trajectory objects
7. Add utility functions to compare trajectories (e.g., Δv efficiency, time efficiency)
8. Create examples demonstrating end-to-end trajectory generation and analysis

Testing approach:
- Verify trajectory propagation against reference implementations
- Test conservation of energy and angular momentum in n-body simulations
- Ensure serialization/deserialization preserves all trajectory information
- Benchmark performance of numerical propagation
