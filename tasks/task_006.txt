# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Basic Visualization Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create interactive 3D visualizations using Plotly and Poliastro to display trajectories and associated metrics.
# Details:
1. Use the pre-installed Plotly and Poliastro libraries for 3D trajectory visualization (refer to documentation as needed)
2. Implement Earth-Moon system visualization with correct scaling
3. Create trajectory rendering functions with animation capabilities
4. Add interactive controls for viewpoint manipulation
5. Develop economic metric visualization (charts, graphs)
6. Implement Pareto front visualization for multi-objective results
7. Create exportable reports combining trajectory and economic visualizations

# Test Strategy:
Manual testing of visualization correctness and interactivity. Verify trajectory rendering matches expected orbital paths. Test visualization performance with multiple trajectories.
