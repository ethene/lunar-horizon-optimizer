# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop Extensibility Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a standardized API and data format to support adding new flight stages (e.g., Earth launch, lunar descent) in the future.
# Details:
1. Define standardized interfaces for all modules
2. Create plugin architecture for adding new flight stages
3. Implement data transformation layers between modules
4. Develop documentation for creating new module extensions
5. Add configuration options for enabling/disabling extensions
6. Create example extension for lunar descent stage
7. Implement testing framework for validating extensions
8. Add versioning support for backward compatibility

# Test Strategy:
Create and test sample extensions to verify the interface works as expected. Verify existing functionality remains intact when extensions are added. Test with mock extensions that intentionally violate the interface to ensure proper error handling.
