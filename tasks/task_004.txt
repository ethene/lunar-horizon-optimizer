# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Global Optimization Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop multi-objective optimization using PyGMO (NSGA-II) to generate a Pareto front of trajectories balancing Δv, time, and cost.
# Details:
1. Use the pre-installed PyGMO library and configure NSGA-II algorithm (refer to documentation as needed)
2. Define optimization problem with multiple objectives (Δv, time, cost)
3. Implement constraints for trajectory feasibility
4. Create fitness functions that evaluate trajectory performance
5. Build optimization pipeline to generate Pareto front of solutions
6. Add result caching to avoid redundant calculations
7. Implement parallel processing for fitness evaluations
8. Develop solution selection mechanism based on user preferences

# Test Strategy:
Verify convergence on test problems with known solutions. Ensure Pareto front contains diverse solutions. Measure performance and optimization time. Test with different constraint scenarios.
