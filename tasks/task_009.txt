# Task ID: 9
# Title: Enhance Economic Analysis Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Extend the economic model with advanced financial calculations using QuantLib, including IRR and payback period analysis.
# Details:
1. Use the pre-installed QuantLib for advanced financial modeling (refer to documentation as needed)
2. Implement IRR calculation for mission investment analysis
3. Add payback period calculations
4. Develop detailed cost models for different mission phases
5. Create ISRU production benefit models with time dependencies
6. Implement risk analysis with Monte Carlo simulations
7. Add scenario comparison tools for different economic assumptions
8. Create detailed financial reporting capabilities

# Test Strategy:
Validate against industry-standard financial calculations. Test with real-world mission cost data if available. Verify Monte Carlo simulations produce statistically valid results.
