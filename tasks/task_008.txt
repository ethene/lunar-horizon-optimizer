# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Local Differentiable Optimization Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop gradient-based optimization with JAX and Diffrax to refine candidate trajectories for maximum economic benefit.
# Details:
1. Use the pre-installed JAX and Diffrax libraries for differentiable simulation models (refer to documentation as needed)
2. Create gradient-based optimization for trajectory refinement
3. Develop loss functions combining physical and economic objectives
4. Implement automatic differentiation through the economic model
5. Add constraints for trajectory feasibility in the differentiable framework
6. Create performance optimizations using JAX JIT compilation
7. Implement interfaces to accept global optimization results
8. Add result comparison to evaluate improvements over global optimization

# Test Strategy:
Verify gradient calculations with finite difference checks. Test convergence on known problems. Measure performance improvements over global optimization alone. Verify physical feasibility of optimized trajectories.
