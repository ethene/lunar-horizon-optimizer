# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the initial project structure and verify required dependencies (Python 3.8+, PyKEP, PyGMO, JAX, Diffrax, Plotly, Poliastro).
# Details:
1. Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore
2. Verify all dependencies are correctly installed
3. Document environment setup process in README.md
4. Create basic project structure with modules for each component
5. Create a simple script to verify library functionality

# Test Strategy:
Verify all dependencies are correctly installed. Ensure JAX can access GPU/TPU if available. Create smoke tests to confirm each library can be imported and basic functionality works.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Git Repository and Project Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational project structure, initialize git repository with proper configuration, and establish the basic folder structure for the project.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a new directory for the project
2. Initialize git repository with `git init`
3. Create a comprehensive .gitignore file for Python projects (include virtual environments, cache files, IDE configs)
4. Create the basic project structure with directories:
   - `/src` - for source code
   - `/tests` - for test files
   - `/docs` - for documentation
   - `/notebooks` - for Jupyter notebooks
   - `/scripts` - for utility scripts
5. Create empty `__init__.py` files in each directory to make them proper Python packages
6. Create a basic README.md with project title, description, and placeholder sections for setup instructions
7. Make an initial commit

Testing approach: Verify that git repository is properly initialized with `git status` and ensure all directories are created with the correct structure.

## 2. Verify Dependencies Installation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Verify all required dependencies are installed correctly and create a simple test script to confirm functionality.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a simple Python script that imports and verifies all required libraries:
   - PyKEP
   - PyGMO
   - JAX
   - Diffrax
   - Plotly
   - Poliastro
2. Document any specific version requirements in README.md
3. Create a simple test that uses basic functionality of each library
4. Document any compatibility issues encountered

Testing approach: Run the verification script to confirm all libraries are properly installed and functioning. Document any issues found with specific library versions.

## 3. Finalize Project Setup and Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Update documentation and create initial test files for the project.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Update README.md with detailed information:
   - Project overview and purpose
   - Required dependencies and versions
   - How to run tests
   - Project structure overview
2. Create a basic test file to verify the environment works
3. Create a simple script to run all verification tests
4. Document any environment-specific settings needed

Testing approach: Test the verification script on the system, ensure README instructions are clear and accurate.
