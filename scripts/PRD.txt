# Overview  
This product is an Integrated Differentiable Trajectory Optimization & Economic Analysis Platform focused on the LEO–Moon stage. It solves the problem of designing and evaluating orbital trajectories that are optimized not only for physical feasibility (using high-fidelity n-body dynamics) but also for economic performance (maximizing ROI, NPV, IRR). It is designed for aerospace engineers, mission planners, financial analysts, and AI/optimization researchers who require an end‐to‐end system for planning lunar missions, with the flexibility to extend the model to include additional flight stages.

# Core Features  
- **Trajectory Simulation and Global Optimization**  
  - *What it does:* Generates initial LEO–Moon trajectories using established orbital mechanics and global search algorithms.  
  - *Why it's important:* Provides realistic candidate trajectories that serve as a baseline, balancing physical constraints (Δv, time-of-flight) with early economic estimates.  
  - *How it works:* Utilizes PyKEP for orbital mechanics and PyGMO (NSGA-II) for multi-objective optimization, offering a Pareto front of trade-offs.

- **Local Differentiable Optimization**  
  - *What it does:* Refines candidate trajectories using differentiable simulation to fine-tune parameters for maximum economic benefit.  
  - *Why it's important:* Ensures that the chosen trajectory achieves optimal performance with respect to both physics and ROI metrics.  
  - *How it works:* Implements gradient-based optimization with JAX and Diffrax to adjust burn timings, Δv levels, and other variables via an end-to-end differentiable model.

- **Economic Modeling Module**  
  - *What it does:* Evaluates each trajectory by calculating financial metrics such as ROI, NPV, IRR, and payback period.  
  - *Why it's important:* Integrates financial analysis directly into the optimization process to focus on cost savings and long-term mission viability.  
  - *How it works:* Uses QuantLib or custom NumPy/Pandas models to simulate cash flows, cost per kg delivered, and the benefits of ISRU production.

- **Visualization and Reporting**  
  - *What it does:* Provides interactive 3D visualizations and dashboards to display trajectories and economic outcomes.  
  - *Why it's important:* Enables stakeholders to explore and understand the trade-offs and detailed characteristics of each optimized solution.  
  - *How it works:* Leverages Plotly and Poliastro for interactive visualizations, with optional integration of Basilisk Vizard for high-fidelity real-time displays.

  1. User logs into the system and loads a mission configuration (payload, budget assumptions, etc.).  
  2. The system generates a set of candidate trajectories using global optimization (displaying the Pareto front).  
  3. Users select a candidate and trigger local optimization refinement for improved performance.  
  4. The refined trajectory is evaluated through an integrated economic model, producing ROI, NPV, and IRR outputs.  
  5. Interactive 3D visualizations and dashboards allow users to analyze and compare mission profiles.
  
- **UI/UX Considerations:**  
  - A clean dashboard interface with widgets for parameter adjustments.  
  - Interactive graphs and 3D visualizers for orbit and economic metric exploration.  
  - Clear presentation of trade-offs and detailed numerical analysis, accessible to both technical and non-technical users.
