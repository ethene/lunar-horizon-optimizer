# Lunar Horizon Optimizer

An integrated differentiable trajectory optimization and economic analysis platform for LEO-Moon missions. This platform combines high-fidelity n-body dynamics with economic performance metrics to optimize lunar mission trajectories for both physical feasibility and financial returns.

## Features

- **Trajectory Simulation & Optimization**
  - Global optimization using PyGMO (NSGA-II)
  - Local differentiable optimization with JAX and Diffrax
  - High-fidelity n-body dynamics using PyKEP

- **Economic Analysis**
  - ROI and NPV calculations
  - Cost modeling for mission phases
  - ISRU benefit analysis

- **Visualization**
  - Interactive 3D trajectory visualization
  - Economic metrics dashboards
  - Multi-objective Pareto front exploration
