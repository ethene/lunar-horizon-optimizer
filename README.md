# 🌙 Lunar Horizon Optimizer

An integrated differentiable trajectory optimization and economic analysis platform for LEO-Moon missions.

## 🚀 Overview

The Lunar Horizon Optimizer is a comprehensive platform that enables real-world lunar mission design and analysis. From basic Earth-Moon transfers to complex economic modeling of lunar resource utilization, this tool supports the full spectrum of space mission engineering challenges.

**Core Technologies:**
- **High-fidelity orbital mechanics** using PyKEP 2.6
- **Global optimization** with PyGMO 2.19.6 (NSGA-II)
- **Differentiable programming** with JAX 0.5.3 + Diffrax 0.7.0
- **Economic analysis** with ISRU modeling and sensitivity analysis
- **Interactive visualization** with Plotly dashboards
- **Extensible plugin architecture** for custom components

**Applications**: Mission architecture trade studies, lunar mining business cases, real-time trajectory optimization, constellation design, investment analysis, and policy planning.
